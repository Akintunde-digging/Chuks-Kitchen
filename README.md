# Chuks-Kitchen
A food ordering app.
I built only the mobile view of Chuks Kitchen, an app where users can register, browse meals, place orders and track activities online. I built the hero page where you can start your order or view more about business, the create account and login pages then two more pages showing the dishes in categories using HTML, CSS and very little JavaScript
 I was able to achieve all this using the figma design prepared by the UI/UX design team of Trueminds Innovations by following very bit of details to the letter. 
The project isn’t complete on my end due to limited time, I started the project so late because of some technical issues which have been resolved now. If given more time, I’ll like to complete the project and give users a full functional ordering interface and experience. I haven’t made it desktop responsive, I started with mobile responsiveness. And because of the constraint of using authentication and APIs follow this rules to be apple to access all pages.
